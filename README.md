### Abstract

In this paper, we advocate in favor of smartphone apps as low-cost, easy-to-deploy solution for raising awareness among the population on the proliferation of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Nevertheless, devising such a smartphone app is challenging, for many reasons, including the required maturity level of techniques for identifying mosquitoes based on features that can be captured using smartphone resources. In this paper, we identify a set of (non-exhaustive) requirements that smartphone apps must meet to become an effective tooling in the fight against Ae. aegypti, and advance the state-of-the-art with (i) a residual convolutional neural network for classifying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from their wingbeat sound, (ii) a methodology for reducing the influence of background noise in the classification process, and (iii) a dataset for benchmarking solutions for detecting Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from wingbeat sound recordings. From the analysis of accuracy and recall, we provide evidence that convolutional neural networks have potential as a cornerstone for tracking mosquito apps for smartphones.
